Behind one door is a car; behind\nthe others, goats. The car and the goats were\nplaced randomly behind the doors before the show.\n\nThe rules of the game show are as follows:\n\nAfter you have chosen a door, the door remains closed\nfor the time being. The game show host, Monty Hall, who\nknows what is behind the doors, now has to open one of\nthe two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have\na goat behind it. If both remaining doors have goats\nbehind them, he chooses one randomly. After Monty Hall\nopens a door with a goat, he will ask you to decide\nwhether you want to stay with your first choice or to\nswitch to the last remaining door.\n\nFor example:\nImagine that you chose Door 1 and the host opens Door 3,\nwhich has a goat. He then asks you \"Do you want to switch\nto Door Number 2?\" Is it to your advantage to change your\nchoice?\n\nNote that the player may initially choose any of the\nthree doors (not just Door 1), that the host opens a\ndifferent door revealing a goat (not necessarily Door 3),\nand that he gives the player a second choice between the\ntwo remaining unopened doors.\n\nSimulate at least a thousand games using three doors for\neach strategy and show the results in such a way as to make\nit easy to compare the effects of each strategy.\n\n[Source http://rosettacode.org]","a/filename.txt":"hello world"}
